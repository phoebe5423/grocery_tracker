###Project Summary
	
The project aims to develop an application that helps users record their purchase products, and the application designer can utilize the data provided by users to analyze consumer preferences. With this application, users can easily track the food purchase history, the food's condition, and the timing of supplementing new food. Users can compare the price and quality of the same products sold in different stores and know which store will cost them less or is worth visiting again. By analyzing consumer preferences, these data can be used in precision marketing. The store can plan a promotion to their main targeted audiences.
 
People usually go to grocery stores but what they need with little plans. But households have limited capacity to store their food in fridges, freezers, and pantries. If we buy more than we need, some items have to be thrown away because we didn’t notice the expiration date. It’s hard to keep track of everything we have and keep in mind to plan ahead. Also, only a few people would make a good arrangement of their space such that the food may be accidentally hidden. In case we waste too much food unintentionally, we need to focus on what we already have and make a precise plan. We tend to manage our groceries in an organized way so we came up with the idea of inventory management similar to a retail warehouse.
